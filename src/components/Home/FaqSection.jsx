    questionKey: "1. What does Aeontrix do exactly?",
    answerKey:
      "Aeontrix builds custom AI systems tailored to your business needs — from AI-powered sales outreach and marketing content to AI influencers, customer support, and internal automations. You only pay for the features you need.",
  },
  {
    questionKey:
      "2. How is Aeontrix different from other AI tools or platforms?",

    answerKey: `We follow a three-phase journey:
    <div class='ml-5'> 
•	<b>Phase 1:</b> Discovery & AI Audit<br/>
•	<b>Phase 2:</b> Building, Testing & Launch<br/>
•	<b>Phase 3:</b> Optimization & Scaling</div>
We begin with a refundable AI audit to assess opportunities in your business. You get a roadmap and cost estimate before you commit.
`,
  },
  {
    questionKey: "4. Is the AI Audit really refundable?",

  },
  {
    questionKey: "5. How long does it take to launch a solution?",
    answerKey:
      "It depends on the scope, but typical projects are ready in a few weeks. We move quickly without compromising on quality or security.",
  },
  {
    questionKey: "6. Can I upgrade or add features later?",

      "Absolutely. Our solutions are modular. You can start small and expand — from cold calling to content creation, influencer automation, or AI customer support — whenever you're ready.",
  },
  {
    questionKey: "7. Do you offer training and support?",
    answerKey:
      "Yes. We provide user guides, Loom walkthroughs, and team training if needed. Ongoing clients receive performance reviews, upgrades, and priority support.",

  {
    questionKey: "8. Can your AI integrate with my CRM or internal systems?",

      "Yes. We support integrations with most major CRMs, calendars, internal chat tools (like Slack), and other business systems.",
  },
  {
    questionKey: "9. Is my data safe with you?",
    answerKey:
      "Security and privacy are top priorities. All solutions are tested for data safety, and we follow best practices in AI security and compliance.",
  },
  {
    questionKey: "10. What types of businesses do you work with?",
    answerKey:
      "We serve real estate firms, law firms, insurance agencies, e-commerce brands, SMBs (medspas, dentists, gyms), coaches, consultants, and marketing agencies.",
  },
  {
    questionKey: "11. Do I need technical skills to use your solutions?",
